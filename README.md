# recruitment: developer assignment
Hi! Really nice to hear that you may be interested in joining our development team. We are a leading provider of RFID test & measuremnent solutions when it comes to RFID tag design AND mass production & personalization.

Here is a very simple example on how to authenticate with Winston (that's what we call our little but continuously smarter and more helpful backend).

What we'd ask you to do is to take a look at the example and take it a bit further. The idea is a LabVIEW application that can query the list of known tag ICs ("chips"), show it to the user and - perhaps if you'd like - user could select a chip from the list and get more information on their screen about that particular chip. When it comes to GUI look and feel, error handling, etc., we let you show in code what is your opinion of good code.

We will then talk in person about the code, life, culture and working at Voyantic if we like your style and you liked the little assigment!

When done, please just make a pull request towards us!
